Task:


Create a `get` route called `/profile` with a required parameter `id`, which will connect to a controller named `ProfileController`. This ProfileController should have only one public method called `index`.


The `index` method will receive the `$id` as a route parameter.  Inside the `index` method declare two variables called `$name` and set the value “Donal Trump” and the `$age` value will be “75”. The values of both variables must be in double quotation.


Then make a `$data` variable to store the `$id` as well as the declared variables $name and $age as an associative array. The name of the keys will be the same.


Also make a cookie; name as `access_token` , value  as `123-XYZ` , minutes as 1, path as ‘/’, domain as $_SERVER[‘SERVER_NAME’], secure as false and httpOnly as true.


Return this data as response with status-code `200` and cookie.

Make necessary changes like renaming the variables, route, method and complete the whole task according to the question. Also do not add the template’s comment in your file/code. Those are just instructions.

   ];


//Set your cookie variables stated in the question


$name = ‘’;


$value = ‘’;


$minutes = ‘’;


$path = ‘’;



$domain = ‘’;


$secure = ‘’;


$httpOnly = ‘’;


   //add the return statement with the response method along with $data and status-code and set the cookie stated in the question.
